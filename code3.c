/* Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in computational mathematics. Strassen's algorithm and the traditional method differ in both time complexity and practical performance considerations.

1. Time Complexity
Traditional Matrix Multiplication
The traditional method multiplies two 𝑛×𝑛 matrices using the formula:
𝐶[𝑖][𝑗]=∑𝑘=1𝑛𝐴[𝑖][𝑘]⋅𝐵[𝑘][𝑗]


This involves 𝑛3n 3scalar multiplications and 𝑛2n 2additions, resulting in an overall time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛3)O(n 3).

Strassen's Method
Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of scalar multiplications by using a divide-and-conquer approach.
Instead of 𝑛3n3 scalar multiplications, it uses only 7 multiplications for each recursive step, with additional 𝑂(𝑛2) additions and subtractions.
Time complexity:𝑇(𝑛)=7𝑇(𝑛/2)+𝑂(𝑛2)
(using the Master Theorem)
𝑇(𝑛)=𝑂(𝑛log27)≈𝑂(𝑛2.81)

2. Space Complexity

Traditional Method: Requires 𝑂(𝑛2)O(n 2) space to store the result matrix.
Strassen's Method: Requires additional space for temporary matrices used during recursion, leading to a higher space complexity of 𝑂(𝑛2log𝑛)O(n 2logn).

3. Practical Considerations

Advantages of Strassen's Method

Lower Asymptotic Complexity: Faster for large matrices due to reduced multiplications.

Algorithmic Improvement: Often used in parallel computing and numerical libraries for high-performance applications.

Disadvantages of Strassen's Method

Overhead of Additions/Subtractions: The reduction in multiplications comes at the cost of additional additions and subtractions, which dominate for smaller matrices.

Memory Usage: Requires extra space for intermediate matrices, making it less memory-efficient.

Numerical Stability: Prone to numerical inaccuracies due to repeated additions and subtractions.

Advantages of Traditional Method

Simplicity: Easy to implement and debug.

Numerical Stability: More stable than Strassen's due to fewer intermediate operations.

Better for Small Matrices: Outperforms Strassen's for small matrix sizes due to lower overhead.

4. When to Use Each Algorithm

Traditional Matrix Multiplication:

Preferred for small or medium-sized matrices.

Useful when memory is limited or numerical stability is critical.

Suitable for educational purposes and straightforward applications.

Strassen's Algorithm:

Better for large matrices (𝑛>128) where the reduced time complexity outweighs overhead.
Used in high-performance computing and libraries like BLAS and LAPACK.
Efficient in parallelized environments due to reduced computational load.
