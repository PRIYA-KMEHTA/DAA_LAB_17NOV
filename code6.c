/* Sure! Here's a comparison without using tables: 

 1. Graph Type
- Dijkstra's Algorithm works only with graphs that have non-negative edge weights. If there are negative weights, it may fail or produce incorrect results.
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm can handle graphs with negative edge weights, making it more versatile for certain applications.

 2. Time Complexity
- Dijkstra’s algorithm has a time complexity of (O(V^2)) for simple implementations using an adjacency matrix. With priority queues (e.g., Fibonacci heap), it improves to \(O((V+E) \log V)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.
- Bellman-Ford has a time complexity of (O(VE)), as it iteratively relaxes all edges \(V-1\) times.

 3. Edge Relaxation
- In Dijkstra's algorithm, edges are relaxed once for each vertex, utilizing a priority queue to find the next closest vertex.
- Bellman-Ford relaxes all edges in the graph repeatedly, up to \(V-1\) times.

 4. Speed
- Dijkstra is generally faster than Bellman-Ford, especially for dense graphs with non-negative weights.
- Bellman-Ford is slower due to its iterative approach but can handle cases where Dijkstra cannot.

5. Negative Cycle Detection
- Dijkstra's algorithm cannot detect negative weight cycles. If such a cycle exists, it may loop indefinitely or give incorrect results.
- Bellman-Ford can detect negative weight cycles during its final relaxation step, making it suitable for applications requiring cycle detection.

6. Implementation Complexity
- Dijkstra’s algorithm can be complex to implement efficiently, especially with priority queues.
- Bellman-Ford is simpler to implement since it doesn’t require advanced data structures.

 7. Use Cases
- Dijkstra’s algorithm is ideal for scenarios where all edge weights are non-negative, such as road networks or applications needing fast computation.
- Bellman-Ford is used in cases with potential negative weights or when negative cycle detection is required, such as financial arbitrage or dynamic network analysis.

Conclusion
- Choose Dijkstra for efficiency in non-negative weight graphs.
- Use Bellman-Ford when the graph might contain negative weights or you need to detect negative weight cycles. */
